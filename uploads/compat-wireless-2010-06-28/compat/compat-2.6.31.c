 * Only one family may be registered with the same family name or identifier.
 *
 * The family id may equal GENL_ID_GENERATE causing an unique id to
 * be automatically generated and assigned.
 *
 * Either a doit or dumpit callback must be specified for every registered
 * operation or the function will fail. Only one operation structure per
 * command identifier may be registered.
 *
 * See include/net/genetlink.h for more documenation on the operations

 * This is equivalent to calling genl_register_family() followed by

 * Return 0 on success or a negative error code.
